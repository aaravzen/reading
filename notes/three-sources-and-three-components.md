The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism

Vladimir Lenin, 1913

1. Marxism (specifically materialist philosophy) is a continuation on other study and provides answers to prominent questions by great minds. Natural science discoveries support historical materialism where they cause idealists to revise their understanding of how the world works.
- Knowledge reflects nature; so to, social knowledge reflects the economic system of society. Politics are a superstructure on the economic foundation.
2. Marx saw relationships between people, rather than things. He understood the dynamics between the players of the game. The cornerstones here are the labor theory of value and the doctrine of surplus-value.
- By increasing the dependence on capital, capitalism creates the giant power of united labor.
3. Utopian socialism has no basis in material reality. The driving force of change has always been class struggle.
- "People always have been the foolish victims of deception and self-deception in politics, and they always will be until they have learnt to seek out the interests of some class or other behind all moral, religious, political and social phrases, declarations and promises. Champions of reforms and improvements will always be fooled by the defenders of the old order until they realise that every old institution, how ever barbarous and rotten it may appear to be, is kept going by the forces of certain ruling classes."
- Marx's philosophy and economics demonstrate the true position of the proletariat within capitalism and explain the spiritual slavery within which we exist.
