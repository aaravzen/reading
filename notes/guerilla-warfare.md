Guerilla Warfare

Che Guevara, 1961

Seven Golden Rules:
● Do not engage in a fight that cannot be won.
● Move continuously, hit and run.
● Use the enemy as the main supplier of weapons.
● Hide your movements.
● Make use of the element of surprise in military actions.
● Form new columns once some power has been won.
● In general, proceed through three phases: strategic defense, balance between the possibilities of enemy action and guerrilla action, and finally the total annihilation of the adversary.

- Guerillas need land they're thoroughly familiar with (including good maneuverability, hiding, and with the support of the people in semi-populated areas) -> this leads them to agrarian revolution, since the main reform in those types of locations is changing the form of land ownership.
- pulls examples of Mao in China, Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, Algeria, Puerto Rico
- continuous blows to the enemy to create the illusion they're always surrounded
- Heavy flexibility, heavy consideration of resources are required. Attrition is the method of attack until the fields are more equal.
- Important guerilla tactics: perfect knowledge of the area; surveillance and foresight as to the lines of escape; vigilance over all the secondary roads that might bring in reinforcements to the point of attack; intimacy with people in the zone so as to ensure their help in regard to supplies, transport, and temporary or permanent hiding places if it becomes necessary to leave wounded compañeros behind; numerical superiority at a chosen point of action; total mobility; and the possibility of counting on reserves
- Need to acquire arms and ammunition a via the enemy
- The conditions for a good social living environment are antithetical to favorable guerilla warfare environments
- Urban warfare must be extremely discreet and must not operate with the same large-scale goals as warfare under favorable conditions - urban attacks must focus on specific tactical goals in order to effectively drive the movement forward
- But the guerrilla fighter, as the conscious element of the vanguard of the people, must display the moral conduct of a true priest of the desired reform. To the stoicism forced by the difficult conditions of warfare should be added an austerity born of rigid self-control that prevents a single excess, a single slip, whatever the circumstances. The guerrilla soldier should be an ascetic.
- Guerillas as social reformers: must explain the necessity of change and demonstrate the necessity of armed revolution. They must work towards progressive radicalization.
- Guerilla as a combatant: physical, mental, and moral qualities required. Should ideally be familiar with the environment. They should be vigilant and audacious; ready to risk their lives but unwilling to risk unnecessarily; cautiously optimistic for the best after analyzing and understanding the dangers/possibilities. They must be close-lipped even among comrades due to infiltration attempts.
- The guerrilla fighter must never for any reason leave a wounded compañero at the mercy of the enemy troops, because this means abandoning him or her to an almost certain death. At whatever cost, the wounded must be removed from the combat zone to a secure place. The greatest exertions and the greatest risks must be taken in this task. The guerrilla soldier must be an extraordinary compañero.
- Guerillas must be indefatigable even when exhaustion seems unbearable. They must be able to endure a lack of food, water, clothing, and shelter. They must also be able to cure sickness and wounds by nature alone within the guerilla zone. They must have an iron constitution in order to become part of the landscape in which they fight. Generally between 25-35 (old enough to consciously make the decision) but 16-65 can be useful and accepted in certain cases. They must carry their homes and armaments on their back, which they should do efficiently and meticulously. To do this, they must have an ideal driving them. They should be able to survive on their own if separated
- The normal routine is the long hike. Let us take the example of a mountain guerrilla fighter located in wooded regions under constant enemy harassment. In these conditions the guerrilla band moves during daylight hours, without eating, in order to alter its position; when night arrives, camp is set up in a clearing near a water supply according to a routine, each group assembling in order to eat together; at dusk the fires are lighted with whatever is around.
- Promotions based on courage, ability, and spirit of sacrifice.
- If encircled, guerillas must hold off the enemy until nightfall, find the best path out, and escape in silence under the cover of darkness. It is extremely difficult to prevent this type of escape.
- The man in the attacking vanguard must always fall into ambush - this creates a growing fear of death without escape for the leader of enemy attack to the point that nobody wants to be the vanguard. Without a vanguard, the enemy can no longer move forward.
- In setting up supply lines, guerillas must pay for the things they receive; in times of extreme economic downturn, they must give bonds or promissory notes ("bonds of hope"). Once food can be centralized/organized, the guerilla forced can act as the dotp of a small planned economy in order to help the constituency of the area.
- Essential foods: meat, salt, vegetables, starches, or grains
- Mules are great for transport under night. Waypoint houses are a necessity to prevent daytime visibility of supply movements.
- Maintaining great relationships with the peasants and being smart about sourcing food and other necessities will allow for a lasting supply for the entire troop.
- The council — or central department of justice, revolutionary laws, and administration — is one of the vital features of a guerrilla army fully constituted and with its own territory.
- Use stereotypes to your advantage, eg. women as couriers to avoid interference and evade harsher punishment
- Relied heavily on breaking immediate communications of the enemy -> how is removing competitive advantage possible within modern technology and communications infrastructure?
- Sabotage can target national scale determined objectives (eg. taking out communications/railroads) or local lines of combat.
- Leather work (shoes, knapsacks, cartridge belts) and armories (weapon repair, explosives) are important industries in guerilla warfare. Iron and tin products are useful for construction. Communications are an important internal industry and lives depend on quick comms. Tobacco, salt, and leather are important ingredients to get. Storing beef in the form of dried jerky is great in uncertain circumstances.
- Propaganda comes in two types: propaganda originating outside free territory (from the national civil organization) and propaganda originating within. The functions of both are related and should be organized simultaneously. It is generally preferable to go with truth in the long term and the most captivating methods of disseminating propaganda should be utilized. Propaganda should promote the ideals and truths of the struggle to gain and keep support from the masses.
- Need good intelligence. Get people (especially women) to infiltrate. Correct information is extremely important. Infiltrated groups have infrastructure laid to sow doubt and fear which can be snowballed/controlled into favorable circumstances.
- When there is a large liberated area and recruits do not have to go through the guerilla struggle, schools are necessary to train and prepare soldiers. These should teach combat and recoup supplies and indoctrinate to establish a great ideological foundation within its members.
- "This is not a model but a description of one reality, of how the organization worked in one country where it proved possible to achieve triumph over an army that was fairly well organized and armed."
- The participation of the people in politics, that is to say, in the expression of their own desires made into laws, decrees, and resolutions, should be constant. Need to foster community and mutual aid, public support and popular participation.
