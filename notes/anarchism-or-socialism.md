Anarchism or Socialism?

The Dialectical Method:
- Dialectics tell us everything in the world is changing (in constant motion). We must ask what is being destroyed and what is being created; what grows and what decays?
- Minor, quantitative changes (evolution) lead to major, qualitative changes (revolution)
- Hegel's dialectical method repudiates all immutable ideas and is thus scientific and revolutionary; his philosophical system, which rests on the immutable idea, is metaphysical (and this reliance on the "unknowable" leads to an unscientific, empty theology). Marx thus praised the dialectical method while laying criticism to the Hegel's metaphysical system.
- How can something be good and bad at the same time? Consider a democratic republic. It is neither all good nor all bad. It is good when it destroys the feudal system but bad when it strengthens the bourgeois system. Thus we must fight for it while it is a positive and fight against it while it is negative. Thus the same democratic republic can be "good" and "bad" at the same time - it is both "yes" and "no."
- Cuvier's cataclysms were due to unknown causes, but Marx and Engel's catastrophes are engendered by dialectics; revolution is not caused spontaneously at random, but is brought on by the development of the productive forces. Darwinism repudiates Culvier's cataclysms and it dialectically understood development, including revolution; it is not accepted uncritically in Marxism, but serves to show both evolution and revolution (quantitative and qualitative changes) are two essential forms of the same motion.
- Anarchists fail to understand the dialectical method of Marx and Engels. They conjure up their own dialectics and fight against them ruthlessly. They fight their own imagination, smashing their own inventions, while heatedly asserting that they are smashing the opponent.

The Materialist Theory:
- "It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness." ~Marx
- Both ideal and material phenomena exist in the world - they exist as different forms of the same nature or society. The dualists said they negate each other, which isn't true. The idealists necessitation on a "universal idea" is nonsense as well. Marxism allows us to identify shifts in power (quantifiable evolutions in "nature" eg. in the material world) that lead to and allow for hierarchical shifts (qualitative changes in the hierarchical structure and "social life" eg. in the ideal world).
- A single indivisible nature can be expressed in two different forms (material and ideal); a single and indivisible social life can be expressed in these two forms as well. They develop simultaneously. This is the monism of the materialist theory.
- In the same way that conscious thought held requirements in the structure of an organism and the development of its nervous system, development of the ideal and of consciousness is preceded by development of the material side.
- Hence arose the well-known materialist proposition: in the process of development content precedes form, form lags behind content. eg. Shoemaker who closes his own business due to competition from larger firms then becomes a proletariat worker. His views will not match those of the proletariat until after acclimation to his new placement within the social hierarchy.
- In social life, too, first the external conditions change, first the material conditions change, and then the ideas of men, their habits, customs and their world outlook change accordingly. In Marx's opinion, economic development is the "material foundation" of social life, its content, while legal-political and religious-philosophical development is the "ideological form" of this content, its "superstructure," Marx draws the conclusion that: "With the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed."
- On this point the materialist theory says that our conceptions, our "self," exist only in so far as external conditions exist that give rise to impressions in our "self." Whoever unthinkingly says that nothing exists but our conceptions, is compelled to deny the existence of all external conditions and their effects on the self.
- "When I look at a tree and see it—that only shows that this tree existed even before the conception of a tree arose in my head, that it was this tree that aroused the corresponding conception in my head...."
- "the existing form never fully corresponds to the existing content: the former lags behind the latter, to a certain extent the new content is always clothed in the old form and, as a consequence, there is always a conflict between the old form and the new content."

Proletarian Socialism
- The economic development of the capitalist system shows that present-day production is assuming a social character, that the social character of production is a fundamental negation of existing capitalist property; consequently, our main task is to help to abolish capitalist property and to establish socialist property.
- the process of production has assumed a social, collective character but the private character of appropriation does not correspond to the social character of production -> since collective labor must lead to collective property, proletarian socialism is inevitable
- Strikes, boycott, parliamentarism, meetings and demonstrations are all good forms of struggle as means for preparing and organising the proletariat. But not one of these means is capable of abolishing existing inequality. All these means must be concentrated in one principal and decisive means; the proletariat must rise and launch a determined attack upon the bourgeoisie in order to destroy capitalism to its foundations. This principal and decisive means is the socialist revolution.
- ". . . The first step in the revolution by the working class, is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class. . . . The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands . . . of the proletariat organised as the ruling class . . ." ~Marx, 1847
- The socialist dictatorship of the proletariat is needed to enable the proletariat to expropriate the bourgeoisie, to enable it to confiscate the land, forests, factories and mills, machines, railways, etc., from the entire bourgeoisie. The expropriation of the bourgeoisie—this is what the socialist revolution must lead to.
- But trade unions and co-operatives alone cannot satisfy the organisational needs of the militant proletariat. This is because the organisations mentioned cannot go beyond the limits of capitalism, for their object is to improve the conditions of the workers under the capitalist system. The workers, however, want to free themselves entirely from capitalist slavery, they want to smash these limits, and not merely operate within the limits of capitalism. Hence, in addition, an organisation is needed that will rally around itself the class-conscious elements of the workers of all trades, that will transform the proletariat into a conscious class and make it its chief aim to smash the capitalist system, to prepare for the socialist revolution. Such an organisation is the Social-Democratic Party of the proletariat.
