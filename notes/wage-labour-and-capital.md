Wage-Labour and Capital

Karl Marx, 1847

- What are wages?
- By what is the price of a commodity determined?
- By what are wages determined?
- The nature and growth of capital
- Relation of wage-labor to capital
- The general law that determines the rise and fall of wages and profit
- The interests of capital and wage-labor are diametrically opposed
- Effect of capitalist competition on the capitalist class, middle class, and working class

Labor-power definition, how prices/wages are determined, social relations between producers vary based on the means of production, "living labour serves accumulated labour as the means of preserving and multiplying [capital's] exchange value", capital and wage-labour presuppose each other, wages are determined in relation to the growth of capital (nominal wages = money amount and real wage = buying power are not as relevant as relative wage = split between immediate and accumulated labor; wages and profits of capital are inversely proportional), "The conditions of existence of the bourgeoisie compel it to attend carefully to its bookkeeping.", the growth of capital causes larger portions of society to fall into wage labour and increasing amount of crises.
