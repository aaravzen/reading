Left-Wing Communism: an Infantile Disorder

VI. Lenin, 1920

Should we participate in bourgeois parliaments?
- Although lefts consider parliamentarianism obsolete, the masses of proletarians are still in favor of it and are often "counter-revolutionary" - this makes it obvious that parliamentarianism is not yet politically obsolete
- It is important to understand that what is obsolete to the communists is not obsolete to a class. You must follow the actual state of the class-consciousness and preparedness of the entire class (not only of its communist vanguard), and of all the working people (not only of their advanced elements).
- Participating in bourgeois-democratic parliament helps prove its obsolescence to the masses and facilitate its successful dissolution.
- Revolutionary tactics will not develop into action without revolutionary mood and the conditions to facilitate the growth of this mood. It will be more difficult to spur revolution in Europe or the US, but it will be more difficult to continue the revolution and bring it to consummation in Russia.
