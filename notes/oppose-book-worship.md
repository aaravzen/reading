Oppose Book Worship

Mao Zedong, 1930

Lesson: must look at class relationships and intersections to understand how the world works and how to fix it.

1. No investigation, no right to speak - either know what you're talking about or do not muddy the waters with garbage words.
2. To investigate a problem is to solve it - don't get lost at large scope; inquire into everything in order to gather the necessary materials to build a solution.
3. Oppose book worship - do not blindly follow directives or information without questioning whether or not it furthers the circumstances of the struggle.
4. Without investigating the actual situation, there is bound to be an idealist appraisal of class forces and an idealist guidance in working, resulting either in opportunism or in putschism - wipe out idealism by investigating.
5. The aim of social and economic investigation is to arrive at a correct appraisal of class forces and then to formulate correct tactics for the struggle - need to find who to ally with and who to overthrow, which is only done via thorough understanding of the situation. Must look at all types of workers/proletariat/bourgeoisie, at all levels (small/middle/rich), in both rural and urban settings.
6. Victory in China's revolutionary struggle will depend on the Chinese comrades' understanding of Chinese conditions - win the support of the majority and do not be optimistic, complacent, or conservative - get into the struggle, investigate facts, foster progressive and militant communist ideals.
7. The technique of investigation - hold fact-finding meetings and investigative discussions. Pull in old people for experience and new people for ideas, pull in those from all facets of life, pull in as many people as you're comfortable with. Prepare and follow detailed outlines, participate personally, probe deeply, and make your own notes.
