Dialectical and Historical Materialism

JV Stalin

"In its essence, dialectics is the direct opposite of metaphysics."

I: Marxist Dialectical Method

a) Nature Connected and Determined
- dialectics regards nature as a connected whole -> no phenomenon in nature can be understood if taken by itself, isolated from surrounding phenomena

b) Nature is a State of Continuous Motion and Change
- dialectics regards nature as a state of constant movement -> requires that phenomena should be considered not only from the standpoint of their interconnection and interdependence, but also from the standpoint of their change and development

c) Natural Quantitative Change Leads to Qualitative Change
- dialectics regards the process of development as passing from insignificant and imperceptible quantitative changes to open 'fundamental changes' to qualitative changes; a development in which the qualitative changes occur not gradually, but rapidly and abruptly, taking the form of a leap from one state to another; they occur not accidentally but as the natural result of an accumulation of imperceptible and gradual quantitative changes.
- eg. ice freezing (abrupt qualitative change) after temperature change (gradual quantitative change) - "What are known as the constants of physics are in most cases nothing but designations for the nodal points at which a quantitative increase or decrease of movement causes a qualitative change in the state of the given body, and at which, consequently, quantity is transformed into quality." (Engels)

d) Contradictions Inherent in Nature
- dialectics holds that internal contradictions are inherent in all things and phenomena of nature, for they all have their negative and positive sides, a past and a future, something dying away and something developing; and that the struggle between these opposites, the struggle between the old and the new, between that which is dying away and that which is being born, between that which is disappearing and that which is developing, constitutes the internal content of the process of development, the internal content of the transformation of quantitative changes into qualitative changes
- thus, the dialectical method holds that the process of development takes place as a disclosure of the contradictions inherent in things and phenomena, as a "struggle" of opposite tendencies which operate on the basis of these contradictions.

If the world is in a state of constant movement and development then it is clear that there can be no "immutable" social systems, no "eternal principles" of private property and exploitation, no "eternal ideas" of the subjugation of the peasant to the landlord, of the worker to the capitalist. Hence, the capitalist system can be replaced by the socialist system, just as at one time the feudal system was replaced by the capitalist system.

Further, if the passing of slow quantitative changes into rapid and abrupt qualitative changes is a law of development, then it is clear that revolutions made by oppressed classes are a quite natural and inevitable phenomenon. Hence, the transition from capitalism to socialism and the liberation of the working class from the yoke of capitalism cannot be effected by slow changes, by reforms, but only by a qualitative change of the capitalist system, by revolution. Hence, in order not to err in policy, one must be a revolutionary, not a reformist.

II: Marxist Philosophical Materialism

III: Historical Materialism

These irreconcilable contradictions between the character of the productive forces and the relations of production make themselves felt in periodical crises of over-production, when the capitalists, finding no effective demand for their goods owing to the ruin of the mass of the population which they themselves have brought about, are compelled to burn products, destroy manufactured goods, suspend production, and destroy productive forces at a time when millions of people are forced to suffer unemployment and starvation, not because there are not enough goods, but because there is an overproduction of goods.
