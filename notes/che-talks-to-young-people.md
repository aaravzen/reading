# Che talks to young people

Che Guevara, 1959-1964

## Something new in the Americas

- Civilization never made an analysis with the necessary depth, from a scientific viewpoint, of the role of moral and spiritual values over the course of history. That is the most important intellectual challenge that the twentieth century has left to youth.
- Che realized the futility of working alone to achieve something great for humanity (childhood dream of being a revered medical researcher) - revolution requires an entire people who are mobilized, who know how to use arms and practice unity in combat.
- Young people must retain their freshness and enthusiasm and learn to lead those who are older and have lost those. They must stay political, to be apolitical is to turn their back on the movements of the world.
- "To the powerful masters we represent all that is absurd, negative, irreverent, and disruptive in this America that they so despise and scorn," Guevara told the students at the University of Havana in March 1960. But to the great mass of the people of the Americas, "we represent everything noble, sincere and combative."
- "Sin cuota pero sin bota" - without a quota but without the boot
- "Although it may seem paradoxical, I would also like to greet today the delegation representing the purest of the North American people. [Ovation] I would like to salute them not only because the North American people are not to blame for the barbarity and injustice of their rulers, but also because they are innocent victims of the rage of all the peoples of the world, who sometimes confuse a social system with a people."

## Never forget, technology is a weapon

- "Every true man must feel on his own cheek the blow to the cheek of another." ~José Martí
- Behind technology there is always someone controlling it; and that someone is society. You can either be for or against that society. There are those in the world who think that exploitation is good and there are those who think it is bad and must be ended. And even when there is no discussion of politics, a political being cannot renounce this inherent aspect of the human condition.
- Never forget that technology is a weapon. If you feel the world is not as perfect as it should be, then you must struggle to put the weapon of technology at the service of society. You must rescue society before that can be accomplished, so that technology benefits the greatest number of human beings possible, so that we can build the society of tomorrow-whatever name you choose to give it-the society we dream of and that we call - as it was called by the founder of scientific socialism - communism.
