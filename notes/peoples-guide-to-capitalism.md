A People's Guide to Capitalism

Hadas Thier, 2020

- “In the analysis of economic forms neither microscopes nor chemical reagents are of assistance. The power of abstraction must replace both.” ~Marx
- "The numbers-crunching power of computers mining Bitcoins requires an enormous amount of electricity—more electricity per year than the whole of Ireland" -> even digital, almost entirely abstract entities are bound to the material world in ways we don't often see or think about.
- surplus value is created in production, but only realized in exchange (M-C creates surplus value, C-M' realizes it)
- The contradiction between socialized production and capitalistic appropriation is reproduced as the antagonism between the organization of production in the single factory, and the anarchy of production in society as a whole.
- Marx identified two key dynamics involved in this scaling up of enterprises: concentration and centralization. Concentration is the accumulation build up (spiraling out) associated with the M-C-M'-C'-M''-... cycle. Centralization is the tendency for industries to come to be dominated by fewer (larger) enterprises through consolidation.

At this point in the book is an excerpt that highlights right-wing talking points about Shenzhen, citing right-wing news sources. Her point begins talking of "megacities" drawing parallels to the trends of concentration and centralization. The title of the section is "Mega Capitalism" but it leads into "Some of the most explosive of these ur ban eruptions can be found in
China, where the number of people living in cities has nearly tripled between 1990 and 2018, adding approximately 527 million people to the
ranks of the work ing class. As of 2017, China is home to fifteen of the
world’s forty-seven megacities."

Thier doesn't explain how the Chinese government prioritized infrastructure development for poverty alleviation, instead preferring, "The city was established as one of Deng’s 'Special Economic Zones,' which functioned as
experimental grounds for market capitalism, dubbed by the Chinese government in Orwellian double speak as 'socialism with Chinese characteristics.'"

There is nothing "double spoken" about the phrase "socialism with Chinese characteristics" and the failure to analyze the greater context of China's progress (for the entire population) after successful anti-imperialist revolt in 1950 points to a dangerous lack of understanding on the author's part. Going from an oppressed people to a country with almost a third of the world's megacities; from over 600 million people in poverty in 1990 to alleviating poverty in 2020.

At this point, I'll be taking a hiatus on this one since I mostly don't trust the author anymore.
