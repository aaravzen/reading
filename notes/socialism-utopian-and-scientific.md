Socialism: Utopian and Scientific

Frederick Engels, 1880

1. The development of utopian socialism
- France in the 18th century. Utopians (Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen) focused on equality in order to emancipate everyone. Having found rationality and reason in the idealized understanding of the 18th century bourgeoisie lifrstyle, they made this the standard. Oppression by sword turned into oppression by gold.
- "Politics is the science of production, and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics" ~Saint-Simon, 1816
- Robert Owens formed communism based on a business foundation in order to reconstruct society for the common good. Three obstacles which especially blocked the path to social reform were private property, religion, and the present form of marriage.
- The utopians believed their truth, reason, and justice of their solutions would overtake the world. But these are subjective. To make a science of socialism it must be placed upon a real basis.

2. Dialectics
- Metaphysics discusses ideas and things isolated, whereas dialectic considers both thesis and antithesis (both positive and negative hypotheses) until truth is found.
- Hegelian philosophy was founded on the eternal change observed. The whole world (natural, historical, intellectual) is abstracted as a process. Hegel wanted intellectuals to follow this process and regarded the world as a culmination of ideas.
- Old materialism looked upon history as irrational and violent; new materialism observes in it the evolution of humanity. Instead of seeing production and economic interests as incidental elements in the history of civilization, we now realize history has been composed of class struggle. Earlier socialism critiqued the failings of capitalism but could not explain how the exploitation arose.
- The discovery of surplus-value explains the secret of capitalistic production to constantly heap increasing masses of capital into the hands of the possessing classes.
- The understanding of the materialistic conception of history and of surplus-value explaining the exploitative nature of capitalistic production (thanks Marx) turned socialism into a science.

3. Historical Materialism
- Proposes that production of the means to support human life and the exchange of things produced is the basis of all social structure.
- The capitalist production and its upholder concentrate and enlarge scattered/limited means of production. They transform individual means into social means of production only workable but a collectivity of men. Production turned from individual to social products such that nobody could say "I made that; this is my product."
- The reduction of individual production's relative efficacy showed the incompatibility of socialized production with capitalistic appropriation - it presupposes the private production of individuals who owns his own product and brings it to market. The relative worthlessness of individual production turns almost all workers into wage-labourers for life. The contradiction (of capitalistic appropriation and socialized production) manifested as the antagonism between proletariat and bourgeoisie.
- Now, the contradiction between socialized production and capitalistic appropriation presents itself as an antagonism between the organization of production in the individual workshop and the anarchy of production in society generally.
- The extension of markets cannot keep pace with the extension of production. The collision becomes inevitable, and as they do not break apart the capitalist mode of production they become periodic in the business (boom/bust) cycle.
- When the state becomes a true representation of the whole of society and takes possession of the means of production in the name of society, this is its last independent act as a state. It is not abolished; it dies out
- The oppressive dynamic of production was necessary in times of deficient development due to the division of labor forming a division based on classes. But this historical justification (insufficient production) no longer exists under modern social conditions in the present period.
- Socialization of the means of production does away with the anarchy in social production and the struggle for individual existence, as well as the extravagance and political control of the ruling class.
